USRP-TV - Using the USRP N200 as a composite video output NTSC signal generator.

It turns out that the USRP N200 with the LFTX card configured to a centerr
frequency of 0Hz (DC) is just a 30MHz 14-bit DAC with a stereo output sample
rate of 25Ms/s. This is really awesome.

Here's a little information about the NTSC signal. This was the typical TV
signaling format until digital TV became popular as of the last decade. All TVs
support NTSC composite signaling still but it is definitely considered inferior
if not obsolete. I will describe it here.

NTSC is an interlaced video therefore only half of the screen by alternating
lines is updated each scan. The screen is broken up into 525 even and odd
scanlines producing odd and even frames. An additional oddity is that 525 is not
evenly divisible by 2. Whoever designed this must have been retarded. What ends
up being done is that the last scanline is handled specially.

262.5 scanlines, representing one frame, are updated per rescan, and various
schemes have been used to deal with this. The three most typical are as follows.

The half-speed half-resolution mode is that the vertical resolution and frame
rate are both effectively cut in half and the same 262.5 scanline image is drawn
twice and is used for both odd and even frames.

The half-speed full-resolution mode is that a single 525 scanline image is
broken up into two frames, with half of the image drawn on the odd frame and
then the other half drawn on the even frame.

The full-speed mode is that a 525 scanline image is generated and half of the
scanlines of the image are selected. Depending on if the frame is odd or even,
the corresponding odd or even scanlines of the image are selected.
